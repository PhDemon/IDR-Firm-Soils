# IDR-Firm-Soils
These files contain a set of data developed using nonlinear time history analysis. 
Inelastic Displacement Ratios (IDRs) were obtianed through nonlinear time history analysis
for three hysteretic models including: (1) Elastic perfectly plastic (2) Large-Takeda and (3) Thin Takeda
The variables considered were: structure period (0.1 to 3.0 seconds) and displacement ductility (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0)
ATC55/FEMA440 strong motions records were considered in the analysis
20 near-fault ground motion records recorded on soil type D
20 far-fault ground motion records recorded on soil type B
20 far-fault ground motion records recorded on soil type C
20 far-fault ground motion records recorded on soil type D
